# Synapse Tech assessment

Thank you for taking the time to do the coding assessment here at Synapse
Health. We look forward to your submission.

## Scenario:

We have implemented a background process responsible for monitoring order status
with the objective of identifying orders that have reached a \'delivered\'
state. Upon detection of such orders, a delivery notification is dispatched
through a secondary API. After the notification is sent, we then update the
order record via API.

Regrettably, the developer responsible for delivering this essential
functionality won the lottery and quit the next day. On their departure, they
forwarded us a segment of code pertaining to this task. While we have reasonable
confidence in its functionality, a preliminary review indicates deviations from
established best practices. Adding to the complexity, the absence of the Product
Owner (PO) due to vacation without access to cellular communication means that
clarifications on the code or its requirements cannot be promptly obtained.

This situation places us at a crossroads, as the business is eager to expedite
the integration of this feature into the production environment. Thus, we\'re
venturing forth to revisit and refine the provided code. Your job is to fix up
the code, make sure it fits current coding best practices and make the code more
supportable.

## Deliverables:

- Solution includes at least 1 Unit test.

- Do not send back a single file answer.

  - At the very least 2 .net projects are expected (a unit test project plus
    whatever you need).

- Make sure this is "Production ready" or as close as you can get.

  - Make notes via comments in places where this is not possible.

- Please add logging where appropriate.

  - Console is not logging.

- Make sure your solution is .Net 6+

- Some way of mocking the API calls.

- Please send the .net solution zipped up via email or send a link to your code.

  - If you send a link, please make sure your repo/dropbox/google drive/etc is
    public.
